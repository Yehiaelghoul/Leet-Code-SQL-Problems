# 📘 LeetCode SQL Solutions – Explained for Everyone
🚀 About This Repository

This repository contains my SQL solutions to LeetCode problems, written with a strong focus on:

✅ Clarity

✅ Beginner-friendly explanations

✅ Real-world SQL thinking

✅ Readable, well-commented code

The goal is not just to solve problems, but to explain the logic clearly, even for readers with no prior programming background.

Every query is written as if I’m teaching SQL to someone seeing it for the first time.
